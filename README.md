This a proof of concept created during my senior year of university. The purpose of the application is to allow honeybee farmers to manage information
about their apiaries via text messaging. The motivation behind using text messaging is that it allows honeybee farmers to update their apiary information in onsite (at their apiaries) with only cellular connectivity.

The code is not unit-tested, as the primary goal was creating a functional, working prototype.

For an overview of the architecture, please see BeeTalk.png which can be found in the root directory.
