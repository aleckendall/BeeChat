This a proof of concept created during my senior year studying of university. The purpose of the application is to allow honeybee farmers to manage information
about their apiaries via text messaging. The motivation behind using text messaging is that it allows honeybee farmers working in places with 
poor network connectivity to effectively update their apiary management information in real-time.

The code is not unit-tested, as the primary goal was creating a functional, working prototype.

For an overview of the architecture, please see BeeTalk.png.
